DOWNLOAD WAY:
1. Export zip folder on Disk or anywhere you what
2. Click on the setup.exe
3. Wait end of download
4. Move "icon.ico" to "dist" folder
5. Create label of "DBDBASE.exe" on Desktop

I know, this way is difficult, uncomfortable and stupid, but NOW, this is all what I can offer to you!
Thank you!
